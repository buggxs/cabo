The app can be used as a addition to the [cabo card game](https://www.amazon.de/Smiling-Monster-Games-CABO-Kartenspiel/dp/B07351NZ6S). 
It is currently available at the Google Play store in testing phase. To publish this app in production it needs 20 people who registrate as tester in the Play store. If you want to be one of the 20 awesome people, please feel free to contact me.
You are also welcome to participate in the further development of the app.
